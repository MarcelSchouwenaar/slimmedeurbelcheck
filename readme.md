# Doe de Check met een Goed Gesprek

This website inspires neighbors to make agreements about the use of smart doorbells in their area. An applicant can fill out a form to confirm they agree about the setup of the smart doorbell. They will then receive a sticker from our organization to place next to their doorbell.

 ## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```

3. Run `install.php` in your browser (e.g. `http://localhost/path/to/install.php`) to set up the database.
4. Remove or restrict access to `install.php` after installation for security.
